## üõ°Ô∏è The Problem

Discord communities are increasingly targeted by scam accounts that:
- Join servers with fresh accounts
- Immediately start sending phishing links or scam messages
- Target vulnerable users with fake giveaways, NFT scams, or malware
- Damage community trust and safety

**Manual moderation is time-consuming and ineffective against coordinated attacks.**

## üí° The Solution

This Discord bot automatically protects your server by:
1. **Detecting new members** with accounts younger than 6 months
2. **Analyzing profile descriptions** for scam patterns (DayZ modder, Arma 3 coder, etc.) on accounts older than 6 months
3. **Automatically removing** these high-risk accounts
4. **Sending humorous messages** to kicked users with information on how to get whitelisted
5. **Maintaining a whitelist** for trusted users with newer accounts
6. **Owner-only commands** for managing the whitelist via Discord

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîç Account Age Verification**: Automatically checks the age of new members joining the server
- **üïµÔ∏è Profile Analysis**: Detects suspicious patterns in usernames and display names (DayZ modder, Arma 3 coder, game developer, etc.)
- **üë¢ Automated Moderation**: Kicks accounts that are less than 6 months old OR have suspicious profile descriptions
- **üòÑ Humorous Messaging**: Sends funny kick messages in Chuck Norris/Bruce Lee style
- **‚ö™ Whitelist System**: Maintains exceptions for trusted users
- **üéÆ Discord Slash Commands**: Owner-only `/whitelist` command for easy management
- **üîí Owner-Only Access**: Whitelist commands restricted to bot owner via Discord ID
- **üìä Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs of all actions for monitoring
- **üê≥ Docker Support**: Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- **üîÑ CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow for testing and deployment

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ or Docker
- Discord Bot Token

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-scam-bot-kicker.git
cd discord-scam-bot-kicker

# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your Discord bot token
nano .env

# Start the bot
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Option 2: Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-scam-bot-kicker.git
cd discord-scam-bot-kicker

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your Discord bot token
nano .env

# Start in development mode
npm run start:dev

# Or build and start in production mode
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Discord Developer Portal Setup

1. Create a new application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Go to the "Bot" section and create a bot
3. Copy the bot token and add it to your `.env` file
4. Go to OAuth2 section
5. In URL Generator, select these scopes:
   - `bot`
   - `applications.commands`
6. Select these bot permissions:
   - `Kick Members`
   - `Send Messages`
   - `Read Messages/View Channels`
7. Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

### Environment Variables

```
# Discord Bot Token
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

# Discord Owner ID (Your Discord User ID - right click your profile and copy ID)
OWNER_DISCORD_ID=your_discord_user_id_here

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

**How to get your Discord User ID:**
1. Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode)
2. Right-click your username/profile anywhere in Discord
3. Click "Copy User ID"
4. Paste this ID into the `OWNER_DISCORD_ID` field in your `.env` file

### Whitelist Management

#### Option 1: Discord Slash Commands (Recommended)

Use the `/whitelist` command in Discord (owner only):

```
/whitelist add username:JohnDoe reason:Trusted friend
/whitelist remove username:JohnDoe
/whitelist list
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Add users to the whitelist with a reason
- ‚ùå Remove users from the whitelist
- üìã List all whitelisted users
- üîí Only accessible by the bot owner (configured via `OWNER_DISCORD_ID`)

#### Option 2: Manual File Editing

The whitelist file is located at `./config/whitelist.json`:

```json
{
  "whitelistedUsers": [
    {
      "username": "TrustedUser123",
      "reason": "Trusted member"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can:
- Edit the file directly - changes will be reflected immediately
- Back up the whitelist by copying the file
- Version control your whitelist if needed

## üê≥ Docker Details

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  discord-bot:
    build: .
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
      - ./.env:/app/.env:ro
```

### Volume Management

- `./config:/app/config` - Contains the whitelist file
- `./.env:/app/.env:ro` - Environment file (read-only)

## üìä Logging

Logs are stored in the container and can be viewed with:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

The container is configured to rotate logs:
- Maximum log file size: 10MB
- Maximum number of log files: 3

## üõ°Ô∏è How It Works

### Detection Logic

The bot uses a two-tier detection system:

1. **Account Age Check** (All accounts)
   - Accounts younger than 6 months are automatically kicked
   - This catches most fresh scam accounts

2. **Profile Analysis** (Accounts 6+ months old)
   - Scans username, display name, and global name for suspicious keywords:
     - "dayz modder", "dayz coder", "dayz developer"
     - "arma 3", "arma3", "arma reforger"
     - "fivem dev", "assisting dev"
     - "game modder", "game developer", "mod developer"
     - "script developer", "passionate about scripting"
     - "building immersive", "sim racing", "flight sim"
   - Detects multi-game patterns (e.g., mentioning both FiveM + DayZ, or Arma + DayZ)
   - Kicks users with matching patterns (case-insensitive)

3. **Whitelist Bypass**
   - Whitelisted users bypass all checks
   - Managed via Discord commands or manual file editing

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Whitelist Commands Not Working
- Verify `OWNER_DISCORD_ID` is set correctly in your `.env` file
- Make sure you copied your Discord User ID, not your username
- Enable Developer Mode in Discord to access the "Copy User ID" option

### Whitelist Issues
If you need to reset the whitelist:
1. Stop the container: `docker-compose down`
2. Delete or edit the whitelist: `./config/whitelist.json`
3. Restart the container: `docker-compose up -d`

### Bot Not Responding
- Verify your Discord token is correct in the `.env` file
- Verify your Discord owner ID is correct in the `.env` file
- Check if the bot has the required permissions in your Discord server
- View the logs for any error messages: `docker-compose logs -f`

### Profile Analysis Not Working
- The bot checks usernames, display names, and global names (not the "About Me" section, as it's not accessible via Discord API)
- Scammers often put suspicious keywords in their display names
- Check logs for any errors related to profile fetching

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```
